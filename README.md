cookie-stand "salmon cakes"

This was a class project that we had done about a fake company that sells

Part of the this is to create tables using javascript.
Another part is to display a table using javascript.
Thirdly is to place a form using HTML Form tags and being able to utilze event listeners/ handlers and appending children onto data.
